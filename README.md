# sidewinder_firmware
its the binary stock firmware for sidewinder x2 3d printer

right now its version 2.0.9.3 build under windows 10 with vscode, config coming from marlin repos here on github, so its stock

was building it after didnt found any binary version and crashed my printer with another firmware (but not able to flash TFT...)

flashing is like all howtos out there, use  stm32cubeprogrammer and pronterface
